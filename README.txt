String Cleaning Exercise
This Python program takes a string name and prints all characters except for the digit '4'. 
It demonstrates a simple use of loops and conditional statements in Python.

Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
3. The program will prompt through each character in the string name, omitting the digit '4'.
4. The output will display the characters one after the other.
